# Introduction
MAGE (Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering) was developed in the lab of [George Church](), based on an existing technology called [Recombineering](). It relies on phage $\lambda$'s [Red]() system. The name *automated* comes from the fact that the original paper[^1] used a machine to automate the whole process. However, in real life most people seem to be doing this by hand.
