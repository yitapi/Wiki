#[Viral dark matter and virusâ€“host interactions resolved from publicly available microbial genomes](http://lens.elifesciences.org/08490/index.html?_ga=1.7952818.1097153616.1458202766)

##notes
1. Difficulties in detecting/describing viral signals:
  a. Plasmid prophages: phages like P1 that exists as a plasmid;
  b. Phages that grows without killing their hosts;
  c. Carrier state of phages. 
2. How often would a large (>30 kb) prophages not correctly assigned as integrated? The authors simulated HiSeq 100 bp reads with NeSSM with different coverages. Results suggested <2.3% prophage-originating contigs would lack identifiable microbial genes.
