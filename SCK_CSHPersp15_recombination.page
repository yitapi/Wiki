#[An Overview of the Molecular Mechanisms of Recombinational DNA Repair](http://cshperspectives.cshlp.org/content/7/11/a016410.full.pdf)

[Genetic recombination]() seems to be a fascinating area I should've known more about. Related area includes [DNA replication](), [Transposition](), [DNA repair]() and the role of recombination in evolution, etc. I plan to read relevant chapters from this Cold spring harbor collection [DNA Recombination](http://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?action=full&cart=14546744692506820&--eqskudatarq=1028&typ=ps&newtitle=DNA%20Recombination). This review is the first that covers topics related to [DNA Repair]().

##notes
* DNA damage can be repaired by multiple systems, homologous recombination being one of them.
* DNA strand breaks (Both single-stranded gaps SSGs and double stranded breaks DSBs)can occur through
    - chemistry
    - replication on a damaged template
    - collision with transcription machinery
* Homologous recombination, as a template based repair machinery, has a better chance of reconstituting the right sequence than [nonhomologous end joining](NHEJ)
* Homologous recombination comprises a collection of potentially parallel and alternative processes due to diversity and size of SSGs and DSBs.
* Core biochemical steps of HR:
    - Initiation
    - homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange
    - branch migration
    - separation of joined chromosomes
* Bacterial pathways for recombinational DNA repair:
    - RecBCD/AddAB: DSBs
    - RecF: SSGs (largely). RecF pathway is nearly universal among bacteria.
* Yeast and Human share many genes. BRCA1/2, not present in yeast, are important to human recombinational repair.
